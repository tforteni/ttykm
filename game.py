Isai: Work on enumerating all possible moves

+ Look into iterator pattern
+ Perhaps pick up where Teni left off with move + Perhaps pick up where Teni left off with move -  I think this would look like having CLI validation where if someone wants to move in a certain direction e.g. 
'e' we check that in our enumerated moves there exists a move with 'e' as the first thing in the tuple

Teni: Implement standard move
+ Command and decorators
