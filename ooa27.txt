We began this assignement by meeting to discuss the project and come up with a game plan and I think that this time of brainstorming providing a very solid base upon which to build. We discussed the classes we would need, constructing a draft of a UML diagram. We played the game to better acquaint ourselves to the rules. In hindsight, I wish I spent more time learning about the design patterns before sleecting and implementing them because due to the time constraints, I didn't have as much time to do that as I'd have liked. I particularly enjoyed working with the heuristic AI and I found that it was easy for me to calculate the scores because we had written code that allowed us to easily access the relevant data. Overall, I had a lot of fun with this pset! My favorite part of working with a partner was definitely getting to brainstorm the design of the project and it was really cool to see how the final project ended up being a blend of our coding styles.
