	My experience working on this project was really great, as whenever we were stuck or unsure of how to begin or continue with a piece of code, we were able to quickly brainstorm a solution as my partner or I came to that realization. Even when a solution was found, we were both able to contribute on fleshing out that solution, i.e. what parameters should a class take, which design patterns to use, what should a function output that would benefit the code and be malleable enough to work on other parts of the code. I learned how to use classes to perform repeated tasks, how to implement other design strategies used in this PSET, and I learned how to effectively communicate with a partner and to have constant and clear communication when explaining my thought process. This assignment was difficult in that there were many different moving parts that all had to come together to properly execute the game, but my partner and I were able to tackle these parts one by one as we worked on getting one part of the puzzle working together before moving onto the next.
